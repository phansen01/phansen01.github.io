## about me

I'm an senior EE student at UIC currently interning at [Uptake](http://uptake.com). This summer I've gained end-to-end experience with industrial-grade IoT architecture, and have gotten to work on everything from backend (Java/Spring/Postgres) to client-side (python) to embedded (C/C++) software.
