## about me

I'm an senior EE student at UIC currently interning at [Uptake](http://uptake.com). This summer I've gained end-to-end experience with industrial-grade IoT architecture, and have gotten to work on everything from backend (Java/Spring/Postgres) to client-side (python) to embedded (C/C++) software.

## my experience
* python (numpy, django)
* C++ (Embedded and backend, plus C++11 features)
* Java (Spring/Spring Boot)
* JavaScript (React, Node)
* bash, tcl, make, cmake
* All sorts of testing suites - Junit, nose, karma, chai, enzyme
* CI/CD tools - Docker, Travis, Jenkins
